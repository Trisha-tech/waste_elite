        <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", fontFamily: "'Roboto', sans-serif" }}>Today, solid waste segregation is the biggest challenge faced by
        urban areas and metropolitan cities across the world. Especially, in a country like India which
        has weak environmental regulations, the situation is becoming worse. Satyamev Jayate,
        the popular TV talk show hosted by Aamir Khan highlighted the seriousness of this issue
        recently. According to a report from Delhi Development Authority, the city of Delhi alone
        produces 25,000 tons of waste every day.  This waste is dumped in the various locations
  around the city like Ghazipur, Okhla and Balsawa.<br />It is also shown inOscar wining movie
  ‘Slumdog Millionaire’. There was a mountain of garbage handled by several bulldozers and
  other bulky backhoe loaders and track excavators. Amidst this pile of waste, numerous rag
  pickers were waiting for new trucks of garbage, while some of them were engaged in
  segregation. Most of them were young kids aged 13-18 years. This is the place where poorest
   of the poor face the challenges of toxicity, health hazards and total quality of life
   because of the waste generated by us. Is there any solution to this grave problem?</p>
